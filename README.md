- Since there is no database, a database service and some dummy data has been created. This has only limited functionalities and tests as this is out of scope.
- Third parties like FlexboxGrid, Angular Material, FontAwesome has been used so as to not re-invent the wheel.
- Components, that are supporting the UI
- More focus is given to Team Depth chart
- The rest of the components are created as supporting structure and lack functionalities as they are out of scope as well.
